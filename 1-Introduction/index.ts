/* 
What ??
    TypeScript is the superset of JavaScript. Means any valid javascript code is also valid typescript code. It adds
    more functionality like static typing, classes, and interfaces.

Advantages ??
    1. It gives us static typing, allowing types to be variable, function, properties, etc.
    2. It identify errors on compile time which reduce the bugs in runtime.
    3. It gives feature like error highlighting on code editor.

Disadvantages ??
    There is no any major disadvantages. Only disadvantages is browser knows only javascript code so typescript first 
    converts our code into javascript first.
